## 1. What is Pointer Arithmetic?
Pointer arithmetic involves performing operations on pointers to navigate through memory.

### Supported Operations:
| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ptr + n` | Moves pointer forward by `n` elements |
| `ptr - n` | Moves pointer backward by `n` elements |
| `ptr++`   | Moves pointer to next element |
| `ptr--`   | Moves pointer to previous element |
| `ptr1 - ptr2` | Finds the number of elements between two pointers |

## 2. Increment and Decrement Operators
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    int* ptr = arr;
    
    cout << "Value at ptr: " << *ptr << endl;
    ptr++; // Move to the next element
    cout << "Value after ptr++: " << *ptr << endl;
    ptr--;
    cout << "Value after ptr--: " << *ptr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 3. Pointer Addition and Subtraction
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
    int* ptr = arr;
    
    cout << "Value at ptr + 2: " << *(ptr + 2) << endl; // Moves two positions forward
    cout << "Value at ptr - 1: " << *(ptr - 1) << endl; // Invalid if pointing to first element
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 4. Finding Distance Between Two Pointers
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
    int* ptr1 = &arr[0];
    int* ptr2 = &arr[3];
    
    cout << "Elements between ptr1 and ptr2: " << ptr2 - ptr1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 5. Comparing Pointers
Pointer comparisons can determine the relative positions of elements in memory.
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int* ptr1 = &arr[0];
    int* ptr2 = &arr[2];
    
    if (ptr1 < ptr2) {
        cout << "ptr1 points to an earlier element than ptr2" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Takeaways:
- Pointer arithmetic is useful for iterating through arrays efficiently.
- Always ensure the pointer is within valid memory bounds.
- Pointer subtraction gives the number of elements between two pointers.
