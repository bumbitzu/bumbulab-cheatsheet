## 1. What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows a function or method to behave differently based on the object that calls it. It enables dynamic behavior in object-oriented programming.

## 2. Function Overriding
A derived class provides a specific implementation of a function already defined in its base class.

### Syntax:
```c
class Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Base class method" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() { // Overrides Base's show method
        cout << "Derived class method" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.show(); // Calls the overridden method in Derived class
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 3. Virtual Functions
A virtual function is a member function declared in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes while allowing dynamic dispatch.

### Syntax:
```c
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { // Virtual function
        cout << "Base class method" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { // Overrides Base's virtual function
        cout << "Derived class method" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* ptr;
    Derived obj;
    ptr = &obj;
    ptr->show(); // Calls Derived's show() due to dynamic binding
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 4. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
A pure virtual function makes a class abstract, forcing derived classes to provide implementations.

### Syntax:
```c
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class implementation" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.show();
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Function Overriding**: Redefining a base class function in a derived class.
- **Virtual Functions**: Allow dynamic dispatch, enabling runtime method binding.
- **Pure Virtual Functions**: Force derived classes to implement the function, making the base class abstract.
- **Polymorphism** enhances flexibility and maintainability in object-oriented programming.
