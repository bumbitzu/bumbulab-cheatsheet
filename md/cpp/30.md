## 1. What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?
Dynamic memory allocation allows memory to be allocated at runtime using `new` and deallocated using `delete`.

---

## 2. Allocating and Deallocating Single Variables
### Example:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int; // Allocates memory for an integer
    *ptr = 42;
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    
    delete ptr; // Deallocates memory
    ptr = nullptr; // Good practice to avoid dangling pointers
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- `new` dynamically allocates memory.
- `delete` releases allocated memory.
- Assigning `nullptr` prevents access to invalid memory.

---

## 3. Allocating and Deallocating Arrays
### Example:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* arr = new int[5]; // Allocates an array of 5 integers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 10;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    
    delete[] arr; // Deallocates array memory
    arr = nullptr;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- Use `new[]` for arrays.
- Use `delete[]` to free array memory.

---

## 4. Dynamic Memory for Objects
### Example:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    Car(string b) : brand(b) {}
    void show() {
        cout << "Car brand: " << brand << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car* myCar = new Car("Toyota");
    myCar->show();
    delete myCar;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- `new` allocates memory for an object.
- `delete` calls the destructor and frees memory.

---

## 5. Common Mistakes and Best Practices
| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Forgetting to `delete` | Always deallocate memory after use |
| Using `delete` instead of `delete[]` for arrays | Use `delete[] arr;` for arrays |
| Accessing deleted memory | Set pointer to `nullptr` after deletion |

### When to Use Dynamic Memory:
- When the required memory size is unknown at compile time.
- When allocating large data structures that outlive function scope.

Dynamic memory management improves efficiency but requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks!
