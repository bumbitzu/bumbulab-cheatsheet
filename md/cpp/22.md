## 1. What are Constructors?
A **constructor** is a special member function that initializes objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

### Example:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int year;
    
    // Constructor
    Car(string b, int y) {
        brand = b;
        year = y;
    }
    
    void display() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota", 2022);
    car1.display();
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Types of Constructors

### Default Constructor (No Parameters)
```c
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    
    // Default Constructor
    Car() {
        brand = "Unknown";
    }
};
```

### Parameterized Constructor
```c
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    
    Car(string b) {
        brand = b;
    }
};
```

### Copy Constructor
A **copy constructor** creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
```c
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    
    // Copy Constructor
    Car(const Car &obj) {
        brand = obj.brand;
    }
};
```

## 3. What is a Destructor?
A **destructor** is a special function that is called when an object is destroyed. It has the same name as the class but starts with a `~`.

### Example:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    
    Car(string b) {
        brand = b;
    }
    
    ~Car() {
        cout << "Destroying " << brand << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota");
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Constructors** initialize objects when they are created.
- **Destructors** clean up resources when objects go out of scope.
- **Copy Constructors** create duplicates of objects.
- Destructors are called automatically when an object is destroyed.
