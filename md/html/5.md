#### **What is a Paragraph in HTML?**
The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph in HTML. It is a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width of its container and starts on a new line.

Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>Each paragraph is displayed on a new line.</p>
```

### **Basic Usage**
| Tag | Description | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `<p>` | Defines a paragraph | `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` |

---

### **Line Breaks (`<br>`) vs. Paragraphs**
The `<br>` tag creates a **single line break** without starting a new paragraph.

Example:
```html
<p>This is a sentence.<br>This is a new line.</p>
```

Output:
```
This is a sentence.
This is a new line.
```
**When to use `<br>`:**
- Inside a paragraph for a **manual line break** (e.g., in addresses or poetry).
- **Avoid** using `<br>` for spacing between paragraphs‚Äîuse `<p>` instead.

---

### **Whitespace in HTML**
HTML automatically **collapses multiple spaces** and new lines into a single space.

Example:
```html
<p> This    is       a     paragraph. </p>
```
Output:
```
This is a paragraph.
```
To preserve spaces and line breaks, use the `<pre>` tag:
```html
<pre>
  This text keeps its
  original formatting.
</pre>
```

### **Nesting Elements Inside Paragraphs**
‚úÖ Allowed:
```html
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> word.</p>
```

‚ùå Not Allowed (Block elements inside `<p>`):
```html
<p>This is incorrect:
    <div>Block element inside a paragraph</div>
</p>
```
üí° **Solution:** Close the paragraph before using block elements.

‚úÖ Correct:
```html
<p>This is correct.</p>
<div>Block element outside the paragraph.</div>
```

### **Styling Paragraphs with CSS**
You can style paragraphs using CSS for better appearance.

Example:
```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">
    This is a styled paragraph.
</p>
```

Common CSS Properties for `<p>`:
- `color`: Changes text color.
- `font-size`: Adjusts text size.
- `line-height`: Controls spacing between lines.
- `text-align`: Aligns text (`left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`).
- `margin`: Adds spacing around the paragraph.

Example:
```css
p {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.6;
    text-align: justify;
}
```
