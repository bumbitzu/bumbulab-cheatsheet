### What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage using a system of elements and tags.

- **HyperText**: Links that connect different web pages.
- **Markup Language**: Uses tags to define elements within a document.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document consists of a set of nested elements. Below is a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type (HTML5).
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element with the language attribute.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata like the page title and character encoding.
- `<title>`: Defines the webpage title shown on the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains all the visible content of the page.
