When using the `<a>` tag, the `href` attribute can contain either **absolute** or **relative** URLs. Understanding the difference is important for linking correctly within a website.

---

### **1. Absolute URLs**
An **absolute URL** is a full web address, including the protocol (`http://` or `https://`), domain name, and path.

Example:
```html
<a href="https://example.com/about.html">Visit About Page</a>
```
✔ **Best used for:**  
- Linking to **external websites**  
- When the full path is required  
- Ensuring the link works regardless of where the page is located  

---

### **2. Relative URLs**
A **relative URL** points to a page within the same website, without including the domain.

Example:
```html
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
```
✔ **Best used for:**  
- **Internal links** (within the same website)  
- Keeping URLs **shorter and easier to manage**  
- **Avoiding broken links** when moving between environments (e.g., local development to live server)

### **3. Types of Relative URLs**
Relative paths depend on the **current location** of the HTML file.

#### **a) Same Folder**
If the linked file is in the **same folder** as the current page:
```html
<a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>
```

#### **b) Parent Folder (`../`)**
Use `../` to **go up one level** in the directory structure.
```html
<a href="../index.html">Go to Homepage</a>
```

#### **c) Child Folder (Subdirectory)**
If the linked file is inside a **subfolder**:
```html
<a href="blog/article.html">Read Article</a>
```

#### **d) Root-Relative URL (`/`)**
Root-relative URLs start from the **website’s root directory**, useful when working with structured websites.
```html
<a href="/products/index.html">Products</a>
```
🔹 **Only works on a live server, not on local files.**

### **4. Absolute vs. Relative URL Comparison**
| Feature | Absolute URL | Relative URL |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Includes domain? | ✅ Yes (`https://example.com/page.html`) | ❌ No (`/page.html`) |
| Works anywhere? | ✅ Yes | ❌ Only within the same site |
| Best for external links? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Best for internal links? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Shorter & easier to maintain? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

### **5. Example: Folder Structure**
Imagine your website structure:

```sh
/website
  ├── index.html
  ├── about.html
  ├── /blog
  │   ├── article.html
  ├── /images
  │   ├── logo.png
```

| Current Page | Target Page | Correct Relative URL |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| `/index.html` | `/about.html` | `about.html` |
| `/blog/article.html` | `/index.html` | `../index.html` |
| `/index.html` | `/blog/article.html` | `blog/article.html` |
| `/blog/article.html` | `/images/logo.png` | `../images/logo.png` |

### **6. Which One Should You Use?**
✅ Use **absolute URLs** for linking to **external websites**.  
✅ Use **relative URLs** for **internal navigation** (easier to maintain).  
✅ Use `../` to **go up directories** when needed.  
✅ Use **root-relative (`/`) URLs** if working on a structured server environment.
