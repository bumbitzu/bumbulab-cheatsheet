### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP provides modularity, reusability, and better code organization.

### 2. Key OOP Concepts
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Acquiring properties from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Multiple forms of a function or method.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details.

### 3. Defining a Class and Creating Objects
A class is defined using the `class` keyword. An object is an instance of a class.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int year;

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;  // Object creation
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.year = 2022;
    car1.displayInfo();
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts direct access to object data by using access specifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`).

**Example:**
```c
class Person {
private:
    int age;
public:
    void setAge(int a) {
        if (a > 0) age = a;
    }
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};
```

### 5. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behavior of another class.

**Example:**
```c
class Vehicle {
public:
    string type;
    void showType() {
        cout << "Type: " << type << endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    string brand;
};
```

### 6. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows a function to take multiple forms, commonly achieved through method overriding or function overloading.

**Example:**
```c
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};
```

### 7. Abstraction
Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only the necessary functionalities.

**Example:**
```c
class AbstractShape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public AbstractShape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl;
    }
};
```

### 8. Conclusion
OOP provides an efficient way to structure complex programs using modular and reusable components. Understanding classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction is essential for mastering C++ programming.
