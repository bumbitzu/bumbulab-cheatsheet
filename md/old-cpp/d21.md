### 1. Introduction
Access specifiers in C++ determine the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and methods). They enforce encapsulation by restricting direct access to data members.

### 2. Types of Access Specifiers
C++ provides three main access specifiers:

| Access Specifier | Scope | Accessibility |
|-----------------|-------|--------------|
| `public` | Accessible anywhere | Yes |
| `private` | Accessible only within the same class | No |
| `protected` | Accessible within the same class and derived classes | No (except in derived classes) |

### 3. `public` Access Specifier
Members declared as `public` can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    void show() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.show();
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. `private` Access Specifier
Members declared as `private` are accessible only within the class.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
private:
    string brand;
public:
    void setBrand(string b) { brand = b; }
    void show() { cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.setBrand("Toyota");
    car1.show();
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. `protected` Access Specifier
Protected members are similar to private members but can be accessed in derived classes.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Vehicle {
protected:
    string brand;
public:
    void setBrand(string b) { brand = b; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.setBrand("Toyota");
    car1.show();
    return 0;
}
```

### 6. Summary and Best Practices
- **Use `private`** for data members to enforce encapsulation.
- **Use `public`** for functions that need external access.
- **Use `protected`** when designing base classes that will be inherited.

Access specifiers are fundamental to object-oriented programming in C++. Proper use enhances security, modularity, and maintainability of the code.
