Properly commenting and documenting code improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration. C++ supports different types of comments and documentation techniques.

### 1. Single-Line Comments (`//`)
Single-line comments start with `//` and extend to the end of the line. They are used for brief explanations.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Output message
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Multi-Line Comments (`/* ... */`)
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are used for longer descriptions or temporarily disabling code.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    /* This is a
       multi-line comment */
    cout << "Multi-line comment example" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Documentation Comments
C++ does not have built-in documentation comments like Java, but developers use tools like Doxygen for structured documentation.

#### **Doxygen-Style Comments**
Doxygen is a tool that generates documentation from special comments.

**Example:**
```c
/**
 * @brief Adds two integers.
 * @param a First integer.
 * @param b Second integer.
 * @return Sum of a and b.
 */
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 4. Best Practices for Code Documentation
- Use comments to explain **why** the code exists, not **what** it does (the code itself should be self-explanatory).
- Keep comments **short and precise**.
- Avoid excessive commenting on obvious statements.
- Use **Doxygen-style comments** for functions, classes, and libraries.

### 5. Example of Well-Documented Code
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/**
 * @brief Computes the factorial of a number.
 * @param n The number to compute factorial for.
 * @return Factorial of n.
 */
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1; // Base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Using proper comments and documentation ensures that code remains understandable and maintainable over time.
