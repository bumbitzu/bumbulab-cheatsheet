### 1. Introduction
Memory in C++ is managed in two main areas: **Stack** and **Heap**. Understanding their differences helps in efficient memory management and avoiding issues like memory leaks and stack overflows.

### 2. Stack Memory Allocation
Stack memory is used for static memory allocation and follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.

#### **2.1 Characteristics of Stack Memory**
- Fast allocation and deallocation.
- Managed automatically by the compiler.
- Stores function calls, local variables, and control flow data.
- Limited in size (stack overflow may occur).

#### **2.2 Example of Stack Allocation**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void stackFunction() {
    int num = 10; // Stored in stack
    cout << "Stack Value: " << num << endl;
}

int main() {
    stackFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Heap Memory Allocation
Heap memory is used for **dynamic memory allocation** and provides flexibility for managing memory at runtime.

#### **3.1 Characteristics of Heap Memory**
- Memory must be manually allocated and deallocated.
- Slower than stack memory due to manual management.
- Large memory space available (until system memory runs out).
- Prone to memory leaks if not properly deallocated.

#### **3.2 Example of Heap Allocation**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int(20); // Allocated on the heap
    cout << "Heap Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    delete ptr; // Free allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Key Differences Between Stack and Heap
| Feature | Stack | Heap |
|---------|-------|------|
| Allocation Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Memory Management | Automatic | Manual (using `new`/`delete`) |
| Size Limit | Limited | Large but system-dependent |
| Lifetime | Function scope | Until manually deallocated |
| Risk | Stack Overflow | Memory Leaks |

### 5. Best Practices
- Use **stack memory** when working with small, short-lived variables.
- Use **heap memory** when dynamic memory allocation is necessary (e.g., large data structures).
- Always **free allocated memory** (`delete` or smart pointers) to prevent memory leaks.
- Prefer **smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)** to manage heap allocations safely.

### 6. Conclusion
Stack memory is faster and automatically managed, while heap memory is more flexible but requires careful handling. Understanding when to use each ensures better memory efficiency and program stability.
