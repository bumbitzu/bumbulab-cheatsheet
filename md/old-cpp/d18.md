### 1. Introduction
Constructors and destructors are special member functions in C++ that are used to initialize and clean up objects.

### 2. Constructors
A **constructor** is a special function that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It typically initializes class members.

#### **2.1 Syntax of a Constructor**
```c
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor body
    }
};
```

#### **2.2 Example of a Constructor**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    Car(string b, int y) {
        brand = b;
        year = y;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota", 2022);
    car1.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Types of Constructors
#### **3.1 Default Constructor**
A constructor with no parameters.
```c
class Car {
public:
    Car() {
        cout << "Default constructor called!" << endl;
    }
};
```

#### **3.2 Parameterized Constructor**
A constructor that takes parameters to initialize values.
```c
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    Car(string b) { brand = b; }
};
```

#### **3.3 Copy Constructor**
A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class.
```c
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    Car(string b) { brand = b; }
    Car(const Car &c) { brand = c.brand; }
};
```

### 4. Destructors
A **destructor** is a special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope. It is used to release resources such as dynamic memory.

#### **4.1 Syntax of a Destructor**
```c
class ClassName {
public:
    ~ClassName() {
        // Destructor body
    }
};
```

#### **4.2 Example of a Destructor**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;

    Car(string b) { brand = b; }
    ~Car() { cout << "Destructor called for " << brand << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota");
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Key Points
- A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
- A destructor is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
- The destructor has the same name as the class, prefixed with `~`.
- Destructors are useful for releasing dynamically allocated resources.

Constructors and destructors play an essential role in object lifecycle management in C++. Understanding them helps ensure proper object initialization and cleanup, improving efficiency and memory management.
