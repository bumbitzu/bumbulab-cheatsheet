### 1. Using `#define` (Preprocessor Directive)
The `#define` directive is a preprocessor macro used to define constants before the program is compiled. Since it does not provide type safety, it is generally recommended to use alternatives like `const` or `constexpr`.
```c
#define PI 3.14159
#define MAX_SIZE 100
#define APP_NAME "CanvasApp"
```

### 2. Using `const` Keyword
The `const` keyword is a more modern and type-safe way to define constants. It ensures that a variable's value cannot be changed after it is initialized.
```c
const int MAX_USERS = 50;
const double GRAVITY = 9.81;
const char COMPANY_NAME[] = "Canvas Corp";
```

### 3. Using `constexpr` (Compile-time Constants)
The `constexpr` keyword guarantees that a constant is evaluated at compile time, making it more efficient than `const` in some cases. It is particularly useful for defining mathematical constants or fixed-size arrays.
```c
constexpr int BUFFER_SIZE = 256;
constexpr double LIGHT_SPEED = 299792458.0;
constexpr int ARRAY_SIZE = 1024;
```

### Preprocessor Directives
Preprocessor directives are instructions executed before the compilation of the program. These directives help in managing file inclusions, defining macros, and controlling conditional compilation, making the codebase modular and efficient.

### 1. `#include`
Used to include standard or user-defined header files, which allow code reuse and modular programming.
```c
#include <iostream>
#include "myheader.h"
#include <cmath>
```

### 2. `#define`
Defines macros or constants that can be used throughout the code. While useful, it lacks type safety.
```c
#define DEBUG_MODE
#define MESSAGE "Welcome to CanvasApp"
```

### 3. `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`
Used for conditional compilation, which allows specific blocks of code to be compiled only if certain conditions are met.
```c
#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
    std::cout << "Debugging enabled";
#endif
```

```c
#ifndef MY_HEADER
#define MY_HEADER
// Header file contents here
#endif
```

### 4. `#pragma once`
Ensures a header file is included only once, preventing multiple inclusions that could cause errors or redefinition conflicts.
```c
#pragma once
```

### 5. `#undef`
Undefines a previously defined macro, allowing for changes to macro definitions within the program.
```c
#undef MAX_SIZE
#define MAX_SIZE 200
```

### 6. `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`
These directives allow complex conditional compilation, enabling different code paths based on predefined conditions.
```c
#if defined(DEBUG_MODE)
    std::cout << "Debug mode is active";
#elif defined(RELEASE_MODE)
    std::cout << "Release mode is active";
#else
    std::cout << "Default mode";
#endif
```

### Summary
- `const` and `constexpr` provide better type safety and efficiency compared to `#define`.
- Preprocessor directives enable code organization, conditional compilation, and modular programming.
- `#pragma once` is a modern alternative to include guards (`#ifndef ... #define ... #endif`).
- Using `#ifdef`, `#if`, and `#elif` can help structure code compilation based on different environments or configurations.
