### 1. Introduction
An **inline function** is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. Instead of performing a normal function call, the compiler replaces the function call with the function code, potentially improving performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.

### 2. Syntax of Inline Functions
To declare an inline function, use the `inline` keyword before the function definition.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Square of 5: " << square(5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Advantages of Inline Functions
- **Reduces Function Call Overhead**: Since the function call is replaced with the function body, execution is faster.
- **Better Optimization**: The compiler can optimize the code more effectively.
- **Useful for Small Functions**: Works best for short, frequently used functions.

### 4. When to Use Inline Functions
- When the function is small (typically a single return statement or a few lines of code).
- When function call overhead significantly impacts performance (e.g., in tight loops).
- When the function does not contain recursion or large logic that increases code duplication.

### 5. Limitations of Inline Functions
- **Increases Code Size**: If used excessively, it can lead to larger binary sizes (code bloat).
- **May Not Be Respected by the Compiler**: The compiler may ignore the `inline` keyword if the function is too complex.
- **Not Suitable for Recursive Functions**: Since recursion requires function calls, inlining is ineffective.

### 6. Inline Functions with Default Arguments
**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

inline int multiply(int a, int b = 2) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Multiply 3: " << multiply(3) << endl;
    cout << "Multiply 3 and 4: " << multiply(3, 4) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 7. Inline Functions in Classes
Member functions defined inside a class are implicitly inline.

**Example:**
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Math {
public:
    inline int cube(int x) {
        return x * x * x;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math math;
    cout << "Cube of 3: " << math.cube(3) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---
Inline functions are a useful optimization tool in C++, particularly for small, frequently called functions. However, they should be used judiciously to avoid excessive code bloat and ensure maintainability.
