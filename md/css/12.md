## Static Positioning (position: static;)  
- Default position for all elements.  
- The element follows the normal document flow.  
- Does not respond to `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.  

```css
div {
  position: static;
}
```

---

## Relative Positioning (position: relative;)  
- The element stays in the normal document flow.  
- It can be moved using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, but it still occupies its original space.  
- Other elements do not adjust to its new position.  

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;  /* Moves the element 20px down */
  left: 30px; /* Moves the element 30px to the right */
}
```

---

## Absolute Positioning (position: absolute;)  
- The element is removed from the normal document flow.  
- It does not occupy space and is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (`relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`).  
- If no positioned ancestor exists, it defaults to the `<html>` document (viewport).  

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```
In this example, `.child` is positioned relative to `.parent`, not the entire document.

---

## Fixed Positioning (position: fixed;)  
- The element is removed from the normal flow and is positioned relative to the viewport.  
- It does not move when scrolling.  

```css
div {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
This keeps the element fixed at the top-right corner, even when scrolling.

---

## Sticky Positioning (position: sticky;)  
- The element behaves like `relative` until scrolled past, then it sticks in place.  
- Requires `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom` to function.  

```css
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
This makes the element stick to the top when scrolling past it.

## Comparison Table

| Position | Stays in Normal Flow? | Moves with top, left, etc.? | Scrolls with Page? | Sticks After Scroll? |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `static`  | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| `relative` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| `absolute` | No | Yes | No | No |
| `fixed` | No | Yes | No | No |
| `sticky` | Yes (initially) | Yes | Yes (until threshold) | Yes |

For modern layouts, `sticky` is useful for navigation bars, `fixed` is great for floating elements, and `absolute` is helpful for overlays or tooltips.
