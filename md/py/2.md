### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical operations.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.3333
print(a // b) # Floor Division: 3 (removes decimal part)
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 1 (remainder of division)
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000 (10^3)
```

---

### 2. Comparison Operators
Used to compare values, returning `True` or `False`.

```python
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)  # Equal: False
print(x != y)  # Not equal: True
print(x > y)   # Greater than: False
print(x < y)   # Less than: True
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal: False
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal: True
```

---

### 3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

```python
a = True
b = False

print(a and b)  # Logical AND: False
print(a or b)   # Logical OR: True
print(not a)    # Logical NOT: False
```

---

### 4. Bitwise Operators
Used for binary operations.

```python
x = 5  # 0101 in binary
y = 3  # 0011 in binary

print(x & y)  # AND: 1 (0001)
print(x | y)  # OR: 7 (0111)
print(x ^ y)  # XOR: 6 (0110)
print(~x)     # NOT: -6 (inverts bits)
print(x << 1) # Left Shift: 10 (1010)
print(x >> 1) # Right Shift: 2 (0010)
```

---

### 5. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

```python
x = 10
x += 5  # x = x + 5 → 15
x -= 2  # x = x - 2 → 13
x *= 3  # x = x * 3 → 39
x /= 3  # x = x / 3 → 13.0
x //= 2 # x = x // 2 → 6
x %= 4  # x = x % 4 → 2
x **= 3 # x = x ** 3 → 8
```

---

### 6. Identity Operators
Used to compare memory locations of objects.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)   # True (same object)
print(a is c)   # False (different objects)
print(a is not c) # True
```

---

### 7. Membership Operators
Used to check if a value is in a sequence.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(3 in numbers)   # True
print(10 not in numbers)  # True
```
