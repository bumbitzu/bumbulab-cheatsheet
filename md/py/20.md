### 1. What is `finally`?
The `finally` block is **always executed**, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is used to perform **cleanup actions**, like closing files, releasing resources, or logging.

```python
try:
    print("Trying something...")
finally:
    print("This will always run.")
```

**Output:**  
```
Trying something...
This will always run.
```

---

### 2. Using `finally` with `try-except`
The `finally` block runs even if an exception occurs.

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

**Output:**  
```
Cannot divide by zero!
Execution complete.
```

---

### 3. Using `finally` to Ensure Resource Cleanup
A common use case is **closing a file** after reading or writing.

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    file.close()  # Ensures the file is closed
    print("File closed.")
```

---

### 4. Using `finally` with Database Connections
```python
import sqlite3

try:
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    conn.close()  # Ensures connection is closed
    print("Database connection closed.")
```

---

### 5. `finally` Executes Even with `return`
Even if a `return` statement is inside `try` or `except`, `finally` **still executes** before returning.

```python
def test():
    try:
        return "Returning from try"
    finally:
        print("Finally block executed")

print(test())
```

**Output:**  
```
Finally block executed
Returning from try
```

---

### 6. Using `finally` to Handle Cleanup in Loops
```python
for i in range(3):
    try:
        print(f"Iteration {i}")
        if i == 1:
            raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
    finally:
        print("Cleaning up iteration...\n")
```

**Output:**  
```
Iteration 0
Cleaning up iteration...

Iteration 1
Something went wrong!
Cleaning up iteration...

Iteration 2
Cleaning up iteration...
```

---

### 7. `finally` with `raise`
If an exception is raised inside `finally`, it **overrides** the previous exception.

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
finally:
    raise ValueError("New exception from finally.")
```

**Output:**  
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: New exception from finally.
```

---

### 8. Best Practices for Using `finally`
✅ Always use `finally` for **cleanup actions** like closing files, connections, or releasing resources.  
✅ Avoid **raising exceptions** in `finally` unless necessary.  
✅ Remember that `finally` **always executes**, even if an exception occurs or a `return` statement is used.
