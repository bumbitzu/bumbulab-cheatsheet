## 1. `for` Loop
Used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**  
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

---

### 2. `for` Loop with `range()`
Used to loop a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- `range(n)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
- `range(start, stop, step)` allows more control.

```python
for i in range(2, 10, 2):  # Start at 2, stop before 10, step by 2
    print(i)
```

**Output:**  
```
2
4
6
8
```

---

### 3. Looping Through a String
```python
word = "Python"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)
```

**Output:**  
```
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

---

## 4. `while` Loop
Repeats a block of code **while a condition is true**.

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**⚠️ Avoid Infinite Loops:**  
Make sure the condition eventually becomes `False`.

---

## 5. `break` Statement
Stops the loop immediately.

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Stops the loop at 5
    print(num)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

## 6. `continue` Statement
Skips the current iteration and continues to the next one.

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue  # Skips number 2
    print(num)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
3
4
```

---

## 7. `else` in Loops
The `else` block runs **only if the loop completes normally (without `break`)**.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed.")
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
Loop completed.
```

If the loop is broken with `break`, the `else` block does **not** execute.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
    if i == 1:
        break
else:
    print("Loop completed.")  # This will NOT run
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
```

---

## 8. Nested Loops
Loops inside loops.

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

**Output:**  
```
i=0, j=0
i=0, j=1
i=1, j=0
i=1, j=1
i=2, j=0
i=2, j=1
```
