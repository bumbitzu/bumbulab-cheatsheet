### 1. What is a Tuple?
A **tuple** is an **immutable** ordered collection of elements. Unlike lists, tuples **cannot be modified** after creation.

```python
# Creating a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)  # ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
```

---

### 2. Creating Tuples
```python
# Empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()

# Single-element tuple (comma is required!)
single_tuple = ("apple",)

# Tuple with multiple elements
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Mixed data types
mixed = (10, "hello", 3.14, True)

# Nested tuples
nested_tuple = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
```

---

### 3. Accessing Tuple Elements
Tuples use **zero-based indexing** like lists.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(fruits[-1]) # cherry (last element)
```

---

### 4. Tuple Slicing
You can slice tuples just like lists.

```python
numbers = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

print(numbers[2:5])   # (2, 3, 4) (Index 2 to 4)
print(numbers[:4])    # (0, 1, 2, 3) (First 4 elements)
print(numbers[5:])    # (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) (From index 5 to end)
print(numbers[::2])   # (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (Every second element)
print(numbers[::-1])  # (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) (Reversed)
```

---

### 5. Tuple Immutability
Tuples **cannot** be modified.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# fruits[1] = "blueberry"  # ❌ TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

However, you **can** convert a tuple to a list, modify it, and convert it back.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
fruits_list = list(fruits)  # Convert to list
fruits_list[1] = "blueberry"
fruits = tuple(fruits_list)  # Convert back to tuple
print(fruits)  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')
```

---

### 6. Unpacking Tuples
You can assign tuple elements to multiple variables.

```python
person = ("Adrian", 30, "Developer")

name, age, job = person  # Unpacking
print(name)  # Adrian
print(age)   # 30
print(job)   # Developer
```

Use `*` to capture remaining values.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

first, *middle, last = numbers
print(first)  # 1
print(middle) # [2, 3, 4]
print(last)   # 5
```

---

### 7. Tuple Methods
Even though tuples are immutable, they have some useful methods.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)

print(numbers.count(2))  # 3 (Counts occurrences of 2)
print(numbers.index(3))  # 2 (Finds the index of 3)
```

---

### 8. Checking if an Element Exists
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

print("banana" in fruits)  # True
print("grape" not in fruits)  # True
```

---

### 9. Looping Through a Tuple
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

Using `enumerate()`:

```python
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

**Output:**
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

### 10. Tuples vs Lists (Key Differences)

| Feature     | Tuple (tuple) | List (list) |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Mutable** | ❌ No (Immutable) | ✅ Yes (Mutable) |
| **Indexing** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Slicing** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Faster** | ✅ Faster (because of immutability) | ❌ Slower |
| **Memory Efficient** | ✅ Uses less memory | ❌ Uses more memory |
| **Methods Available** | ❌ Fewer (`count()`, `index()`) | ✅ Many (`append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.) |

---

### 11. When to Use Tuples?
✅ When you need an **immutable** sequence of elements.  
✅ When performance is critical (tuples are **faster** than lists).  
✅ When storing **fixed collections of items** (e.g., coordinates, database records).
