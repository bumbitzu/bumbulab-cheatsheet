### 1. `break` Statement
Stops the loop **immediately** when the condition is met.

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when num is 5
    print(num)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

Used in `while` loops as well:

```python
x = 0
while x < 10:
    if x == 5:
        break
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

### 2. `continue` Statement
Skips the **current iteration** and moves to the next one.

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue  # Skips 2
    print(num)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
3
4
```

Used in `while` loops as well:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 3:
        continue  # Skip 3
    print(x)
```

**Output:**  
```
1
2
4
5
```

---

### 3. `pass` Statement
A placeholder that **does nothing** (used to prevent syntax errors in empty blocks).

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    print(num)
```

**Output:**  
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

Useful in defining functions or loops that you plan to implement later:

```python
def future_function():
    pass  # To be implemented later
```

### 4. `break` vs `continue` vs `pass`
| Statement  | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| `break`    | Exits the loop completely |
| `continue` | Skips the current iteration and moves to the next |
| `pass`     | Does nothing (placeholder) |
