### 1. Single-Line Comments
Use the `#` symbol to write a comment on a single line.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 5  # This is an inline comment
```

---

### 2. Multi-Line Comments (Using `#`)
Although Python doesn’t have a built-in multi-line comment syntax, you can use `#` at the beginning of each line.

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# that spans multiple lines
# using the hash symbol.
```

---

### 3. Multi-Line Comments (Using Triple Quotes)
Triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) are often used for docstrings but can also be used as multi-line comments.

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
using triple double-quotes.
"""
'''
This is another way to write
multi-line comments.
'''
```
**Note:** Triple-quoted comments are technically strings, but if not assigned to a variable, they are ignored by Python.

---

### 4. Docstrings (Documentation Strings)
Docstrings describe modules, functions, classes, or methods.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """This function adds two numbers and returns the result."""
    return a + b
```
To view a function’s docstring:

```python
print(add.__doc__)
```

---

### 5. Commenting Out Code
You can use comments to temporarily disable lines of code.

```python
x = 10
# y = 20  # This line is ignored
print(x)
```

---

### 6. Using Comments for Debugging
You can comment out different parts of your code to isolate issues.

```python
x = 5
# print(x + 2)
print(x * 2)  # Debugging different outputs
```

---

### 7. Best Practices for Comments
- **Keep comments concise and meaningful.**
- **Use comments to explain why, not what.**
- **Avoid obvious comments.**
- **Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.**
- **Keep comments updated when code changes.**

Example of a well-commented function:

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    """Returns the area of a circle given its radius."""
    pi = 3.14159  # Approximate value of π
    return pi * (radius ** 2)
```
