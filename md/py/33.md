# Python Virtual Environments (`venv`) Cheat Sheet

### 1. What is `venv`?
- `venv` is a built-in Python module used to create **isolated virtual environments**.
- Each virtual environment has its **own dependencies**, independent of the system Python.

---

### 2. Creating a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
python -m venv myenv
```
- `myenv` is the name of the virtual environment (you can change it).

---

### 3. Activating the Virtual Environment
#### **On Windows (CMD)**
```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
#### **On Windows (PowerShell)**
```sh
myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
⚠ If you get a security error, try:
```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```

#### **On macOS/Linux**
```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

### 4. Checking If Virtual Environment is Active
Run:
```sh
which python  # macOS/Linux
where python   # Windows
```
If the path shows your `myenv` directory, it's activated.

---

### 5. Installing Packages in Virtual Environment
```sh
pip install package_name
```
Example:
```sh
pip install requests
```

---

### 6. Viewing Installed Packages
```sh
pip list
```

---

### 7. Freezing Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
Save all installed packages to a file:
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
Restore dependencies in another environment:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 8. Deactivating Virtual Environment
To exit the virtual environment:
```sh
deactivate
```

---

### 9. Deleting a Virtual Environment
Simply remove the folder:
```sh
rm -rf myenv  # macOS/Linux
rmdir /s myenv  # Windows (Command Prompt)
```

---

### 10. Best Practices for Virtual Environments
✅ Always create a virtual environment per project.  
✅ Use `requirements.txt` for easy dependency management.  
✅ Activate the virtual environment before running Python scripts.  
✅ Use `deactivate` before switching projects.
