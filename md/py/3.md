### 1. The `if` Statement
Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

**Output:**  
`You are an adult.` (since `age >= 18` is `True`)

---

### 2. The `if-else` Statement
Provides an alternative action if the condition is `False`.

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

**Output:**  
`You are a minor.`

---

### 3. The `if-elif-else` Statement
Checks multiple conditions in sequence.

```python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

**Output:**  
`Grade: C`

---

### 4. Nested `if` Statements
An `if` statement inside another `if` statement.

```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_id:
        print("You can enter.")
    else:
        print("You need an ID.")
else:
    print("You are not allowed.")
```

**Output:**  
`You can enter.`

---

### 5. Using Logical Operators with `if`
You can combine conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`.

```python
age = 19
has_ticket = True

if age >= 18 and has_ticket:
    print("You can watch the movie.")
```

**Output:**  
`You can watch the movie.`

---

### 6. The Ternary (Conditional) Operator
A compact way to write `if-else` statements.

```python
age = 17
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```

**Output:**  
`Minor`

---

### 7. The `pass` Statement
Used when an `if` block is required but you donâ€™t want to execute any code.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
```
