### 1. Opening a File
Use the `open()` function to open a file.

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open in read mode
```

#### File Modes:
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `"r"`  | Read mode (default) |
| `"w"`  | Write mode (overwrites file) |
| `"a"`  | Append mode (adds to the end) |
| `"x"`  | Create a new file (fails if file exists) |
| `"b"`  | Binary mode (`rb`, `wb`, `ab`) |

### 2. Reading a File
#### Read the Entire File
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

#### Read a Specific Number of Characters
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read(10)  # Read first 10 characters
    print(content)
```

#### Read File Line by Line
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Removes extra spaces
```

#### Read All Lines into a List
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)  # ['Line 1\n', 'Line 2\n']
```

---

### 3. Writing to a File
#### Overwrite File Content
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
```
**âš  This will erase existing content!**

#### Append to a File
```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This is a new line.\n")
```

---

### 4. Working with Binary Files
#### Reading a Binary File (e.g., images)
```python
with open("image.png", "rb") as file:
    data = file.read()
```

#### Writing a Binary File
```python
with open("copy.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(data)
```

---

### 5. Using `with` Statement (Best Practice)
The `with` statement automatically **closes** the file after use.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

Without `with`, you must **close** the file manually:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

---

### 6. Checking if a File Exists (Before Opening)
```python
import os

if os.path.exists("example.txt"):
    print("File exists!")
else:
    print("File not found.")
```

---

### 7. Creating a New File (Fails if Exists)
```python
with open("newfile.txt", "x") as file:
    file.write("This is a new file.")
```

---

### 8. Deleting a File
```python
import os

if os.path.exists("example.txt"):
    os.remove("example.txt")
    print("File deleted.")
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

---

### 9. Working with File Paths (`pathlib`)
```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("example.txt")

if file_path.exists():
    print(f"File size: {file_path.stat().st_size} bytes")
```

---

### 10. Example: Copying a File
```python
with open("source.txt", "r") as src, open("destination.txt", "w") as dest:
    dest.write(src.read())
```
