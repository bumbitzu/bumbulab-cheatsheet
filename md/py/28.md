### 1. What is Threading?
- The `threading` module allows for **concurrent execution** of multiple threads.
- Threads share the same memory space and can run tasks **in parallel**.

```python
import threading
```

---

### 2. Creating and Starting a Thread
```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Number: {i}")

# Creating a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)

# Starting the thread
thread.start()

# Wait for thread to finish
thread.join()

print("Main thread finished")
```

---

### 3. Using Multiple Threads
```python
def task(name):
    print(f"Task {name} is running")

# Creating multiple threads
threads = []
for i in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=task, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Waiting for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

---

### 4. Thread with a Class (`Thread` Subclass)
```python
class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name

    def run(self):  # Overriding the run() method
        print(f"Thread {self.name} is running")

# Creating and starting a thread
thread = MyThread("A")
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

---

### 5. Daemon Threads (Background Tasks)
Daemon threads **run in the background** and terminate when the main program exits.

```python
def background_task():
    while True:
        print("Running in background...")

thread = threading.Thread(target=background_task, daemon=True)
thread.start()
```

**⚠ Warning:** Daemon threads terminate when the main thread exits.

---

### 6. Thread Synchronization (Using `Lock`)
Avoid race conditions when multiple threads access shared data.

```python
import time

lock = threading.Lock()
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(10000):
        with lock:  # Ensures only one thread modifies `counter` at a time
            counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print("Final Counter:", counter)  # Should be 20000
```

---

### 7. Using `Event` for Thread Communication
- `Event` allows one thread to signal another.

```python
event = threading.Event()

def worker():
    print("Waiting for event...")
    event.wait()  # Blocks until event is set
    print("Event triggered, running!")

thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread.start()

import time
time.sleep(2)  # Simulate delay
event.set()  # Signal the event
```

---

### 8. Using `Queue` for Thread-Safe Communication
The `queue.Queue` class is **thread-safe**.

```python
import queue

task_queue = queue.Queue()

def worker():
    while not task_queue.empty():
        item = task_queue.get()
        print(f"Processing {item}")
        task_queue.task_done()

# Adding tasks
for i in range(5):
    task_queue.put(i)

# Creating and starting threads
threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(2)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

task_queue.join()  # Wait for all tasks to complete
```

---

### 9. Using `Semaphore` for Resource Control
A semaphore **limits the number of concurrent threads**.

```python
semaphore = threading.Semaphore(2)  # Allows max 2 threads

def task(i):
    with semaphore:
        print(f"Thread {i} is running")
        import time
        time.sleep(2)

threads = [threading.Thread(target=task, args=(i,)) for i in range(5)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

---

### 10. Threading vs Multiprocessing
| Feature | threading (Threads) | multiprocessing (Processes) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Memory Usage | Shared memory | Separate memory space |
| Best For | I/O-bound tasks | CPU-bound tasks |
| GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) | Affected by GIL | Bypasses GIL |
| Performance | Better for network & file I/O | Better for CPU-intensive tasks |

---

### 11. Best Practices for Threading
✅ Use `thread.join()` to ensure threads finish execution.  
✅ Use `Lock` when modifying **shared resources** to avoid race conditions.  
✅ Use `Queue` for **safe** inter-thread communication.  
✅ Use **daemon threads** for background tasks that should exit with the program.  
✅ For CPU-intensive tasks, consider using **multiprocessing** instead of threading.
